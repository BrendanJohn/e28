# Vue.js versus React: A Comparison of Key Benefits, Drawbacks, and Essential Use Cases

## Common features of React and Vue.js
Vue.js and React are both javascript libraries used primarily in front-end development and each uses a virtual Document Object Model(DOM). 
Each library also provides reactive and composable view components. //TODO more research here 

## Key benefits and features of React
React is a web framework/library that is used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. 
Competing opinion from PluralSight author Cory House.. He contends that React is not a framework, but instead a library that has allowed it to evolve into a remarkabley flexible tool. //TODO more research here  
Initial released on May 29, 2013.  
Developed by Facebook 

## Drawbacks of React
Some drawbacks of React include... 
Optimization: In React, when a component's state changes, it triggers the re-render of the entire component sub-tree, starting at that component as root. 
React has a javascript-centric approach versus a template-centric approach like Vue, resulting in a library the demands more upfront knowledge of essential javascript from its developers. 

## Ideal use cases
Ideal use cases of React include mobile application with react native, web development with react and redux, and virtual reality websites and 360 experiences using React VR. 

## Key benefits and features of Vue.js
Incrementally adoptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition.  
Initial released in February 2014. 

Vue is described as a progressive framework, meaning it can be incorporated into existing projects incrementally as needed. This is beneficial for developers because they are able to sprinkle in the
effeciencies and dynamic front-end features of vue without starting over from scratch. 

Vue is driven entirely by the open source community, whereas Angular and React have a significant share of Google and Facebook employees contributing to the repositories. //TODO more research here  
Low barrier to entry due to it being a template-centric library 

## Drawbacks of Vue.js
Some drawbacks of Vue.js include... 
Small community of developers due to its relatively new prescence and light corporate backing (also maybe a benefit?)

## Ideal use cases of Vue.js
Ideal use cases of Vue.js is this this, and this  
Single-Page applications, responsive web application, or as mall web components in larger monolithic applications

## Conclusion, when to use each library in terms of use cases and examples
In conclusion...Each framework has a unique set of benefits and drawbacks
