# Vue.js versus React: A Comparison of Key Benefits, Drawbacks, and Essential Use Cases

## Common features of React and Vue.js
Each is a javascript library used primarily in front-end development and each uses a virtual Document Object Model (DOM). 
Each framework also provides reactive and composable view components. 

## Key features of React
React is a web framework used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. 
Competing opinion from PluralSight author Cory House, he contends that React is not a framework, but instead a library that has allowed it to evolve into a remarkabley flexible tool.

## Drawbacks of React
Some drawbacks of React include...
Optimization: In React, when a component's state changes, it triggers the re-render of the entire component sub-tree, starting at that component as root.
React has a javascript-centric approach versus a template-centric approach like Vue, resulting in a library the demands more upfront knowledge of essential javascript from its developers.

## Ideal use case
Ideal use case of React include mobile application with react native, web development with react and redux, and virtual reality websites and 360 experiences using React VR.

## Key features of Vue.js
Incrementally adoptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. 
Initial released in February 2014.

Vue is described as a progressive framework, meaning it can be incorporated into existing projects incrementally as needed. This is beneficial for developers because they are able to sprinkle in the
effeciencies and dynamic front-end features of vue without starting over from scratch.
