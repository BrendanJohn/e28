## Server interaction
Home page, recipes page, and categories page each retrieve data from the server using an api call to firebase.  
Add a recipe page persists new recipes to the server using the same api call to firebase.  
Favorites page does not persist or retrieve data from the server, instead data is persisted and retrieved from local storage within the browser.
